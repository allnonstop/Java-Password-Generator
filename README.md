# Java Password Generator

  This is just a very basic password generator I made over the weekend.
  I'm still very much a beginner at this and am open to feedback on ways
  to improve my code. You can use this code anyway you like. 
  
~ To generate a new password, simply press the generate button. 

~ The user is given the choice to include or exclude upper case, lower case,
  number, and symbol characters via checkboxes. 
  
~ The initial password length is set to be 12 characters long. This can be
  changed with the add and subtract buttons beneath the length label.
  
~ The minimum password length allowed is 4 characters long while the maximum 
  is set to 24. 

~ If the user has unchecked all of the character types they will be prompted
  to enable a character type. They will not be able to generate a new 
  password until they do. 

~ To copy the password the user can simply press ( ctrl+a ) to selecct
  the password, followed by ( ctrl+c ) to copy the password. The user 
  may also copy the password using their mouse by highlighting the password.
